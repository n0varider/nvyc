# nvyc

A language compiler targeting LLVM.

This is a person project I have been working on on-and-off for about 2-3 years now with the goal of looking up as little as possible to see how far I could get on my own. 

Currently implemented features:
- Functions
- Variables
- Structs (minimal)
- Arrays (minimal)
- For loops
- Branching with if (no else yet)
- Imports
- Native function declarations for use with DLLs
